We have created the Image model you are going to use and the Service which is responsible for managing all Images operations. We would like you to implement these operations by creating a new Web Application. For the implementation of this application we would not like to pay much attention on the ui interface you are going to create, but on the infrastructure of your code.
As for the Azure Blob storage operations you may use just the local windows azure emulator.

Inside the class library which contains the Image model and the corresponding Service Interface we describe through comments which will be the functionality of each operation. If something is not clear enough, feel free to ask any question you may have.

We would like you to create a github account and to commit your code progress there. When your project is totally completed just send us an email. 
It is important for us not just to commit at once your project but to commit your progress adding the corresponding comments.

Kind Regards,
